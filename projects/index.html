                <p>
                    This project is to create an online source for IIT KGP CS students. The main idea behind this project is to create a network where users login and post materials with a respective <a href="#tag">subject tag</a>, and these materials will be rated by other users and based on the user ratings the material can replace the existing material for that topic(if the rating of this material is less than new material), else the posted material will be automatically deleted after few days. Thus helping
                    students to have the best material available and save their time and space(If we have more than one material for a subject there is a chance that users may get confused which to read and it also occupies data on the database.) and if two or materials are good at differents parts of the same topic, then neccessary actions will be taken to merge the materials on suggestions.
                </p>
                <a name="tag"></a>
                <h4>Subject Tag</h4>
                <p>
                    Subject tag is nothing but a means to specify which topic the given material discusses about. There is a chance to
                    raise newer subject tags, which are later submitted for review and based on their ratings, they may become a permanent tag.
                    <br/>
                    And there will only be one material for a tag.User can submit a material for a tag without a material, but it has to cross a threshold rating<sup>4/10</sup> to get into the database.

                <h3>Project <span>Let's make it easy for beginners</span></h3>
                <p>
                    The aim of this project is to make things easier for beginners in programming, the faster the newbies learn the better experience the world gets(Just my quote :-p ), and the Idea behind this project is to get suggestions from users on how to and where to start studying from so that they get a better idea on things.
                    And finally, when we reach the position where we feel things are advanced to learn, we create a material of all the things discussed and make it available as a pdf document for free which beginners can prepare offline.
